## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

This repository serves as my **learning journal** as I work toward an Epic Cupid–focused role.

I specifically aim to:

- **Document my learning journey, not Epic’s IP**
- Demonstrate **continuous learning** and systems thinking
- Focus on **high-level concepts** and **industry standards** rather than build details

What you will find here:

- ✅ **General concepts only** – architecture patterns, workflows, and standards (HL7, DICOM, IHE, etc.)  
- ✅ **Personal reflections** – what I am learning, challenges, and insights  
- ✅ **External references** – links to public articles, white papers, and research  
- ✅ **Generic workflows** – described in EMR-agnostic terms  
- ✅ **Original conceptual diagrams** – my own visuals (not screenshots or replicas of Epic content)

All material is created with respect for **Epic’s intellectual property** and **industry best practices** for educational sharing.
